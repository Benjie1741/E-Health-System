    Download whole project from github and save it in XAMPP / htdocs
    go to localhost/phpmyadmin in either google chrome or firefox
    create a database called eHealth
    navigate to /backend/database/ehealth.sql and copy the sql
    In phpmyadmin either upload the ehealth.sql file, or insert the sql code directly
    go to localhost/ and click on e-health-system-master
    You can now login as a doctor using the credentials email: g@g.com password: 123
    Now you have access to the whole system.
